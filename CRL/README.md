# Contrast Representation Learning from Imaging Parameters for Magnetic Resonance Image Synthesis

#### Step 1. To organize your multi-contrast dataset similar to the paths in configs/train_crl.yaml, you should structure it in a systematic way that reflects the different contrasts. Below is an example of how you could structure your dataset:

#### Step 2. Train the model by simply running the following command:
     
     python train.py
